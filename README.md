# code-puzzles
Code puzzles. Good for keeping up with algorithm theory and data structures

Factorial: recursive and iterative

##Example 2
Give a list of parenthesis symbols like [,],{,},(,) in a   string. ex "{[[(}[}])", write a program to return True if the symbols are complete. i.e. "{}" is True, "}{" is False.
