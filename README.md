# code-puzzles
Code puzzles. Good for keeping up with algorithm theory and data structures

##Example 1
Factorial: recursive and iterative

##Example 2
Give a list of parenthesis symbols like [,],{,},(,) in a   string. ex "{[[(}[}])", write a program to return True if the symbols are complete. i.e. "{}" is True, "}{" is False.

##Example 3
Write code to check a String is palindrome or not.
Palindrome are those String whose reverse is equal to original.

##Example 4
FizzBuzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

##Example 5
Prime number and Erastotenes sieve

##Example 6
Write code to sum 2 integer but you cant use a+b method, you have to use either ++ or --. How you will handle negative numbers.

##Example 7
Given a text, give the most used words. Order them by frequency and in case of same frequency by alphabetical order. No guava.

##Example 8
You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
For example, given:
  `[1, 7, 3, 4]`
  
your function would return:
  `[84, 12, 28, 21]`
  
by calculating:
  `[7*3*4, 1*3*4, 1*7*4, 1*7*3]`

No use of division

##Example 9
Fibonacci: recursive and iterative

##Example 10
Given an array_of_ints, find the highest_product you can get from three of the integers.
